/**
 * @brief       This function serves to set the working mode of MCU based on 32k crystal,e.g. suspend mode, deep sleep mode, deep sleep with SRAM retention mode and shutdown mode.
 * @param[in]   sleep_mode          - sleep mode type select.
 * @param[in]   wakeup_src          - wake up source select.
 * @param[in]   wakeup_tick         - The tick value at the time of wake-up.
                                      If the wakeup_tick_type is PM_TICK_STIMER, then wakeup_tick is converted to 24M. The range of tick that can be set is approximately:
                                      current tick value + (18352~0xe0000000), and the corresponding sleep time is approximately: 2ms~234.88s.It cannot go to sleep normally when it exceeds this range.
                                      If the wakeup_tick_type is PM_TICK_32K, then wakeup_tick is converted to 32K. The range of tick that can be set is approximately:
                                      64~0xffffffff, and the corresponding sleep time is approximately: 2ms~37hours.It cannot go to sleep normally when it exceeds this range.
 * @note        There are two things to note when using LPC wake up:
 *              1.After the LPC is configured, you need to wait 100 seconds before you can go to sleep. After the LPC is opened, 1-2 32k tick is needed to calculate the result.
 *                Before this, the data in the result register is random. If you enter the sleep function at this time,
 *                you may not be able to sleep normally because the data in the result register is abnormal.
 *              2.When entering sleep, keep the input voltage and reference voltage difference must be greater than 30mV, otherwise can not enter sleep normally, crash occurs.
 * @return      indicate whether the cpu is wake up successful.
