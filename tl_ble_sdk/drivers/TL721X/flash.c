 * @brief       This function serves to set priority threshold. When the interrupt priority is greater than the maximum of the current interrupt threshold and the given interrupt threshold, flash process will disturb by interrupt.

 * @note
 *              -# The correlation between flash_plic_preempt_config() and the flash functions that call sub-functions (all declared in flash_base.h) is as follows:
 *                  - When preempt_en = 1 and interrupt nesting is enabled (plic_preempt_feature_en):
 *                      - During the flash functions execution, the threshold of the PLIC is set to the maximum of the threshold before calling the interface and the given threshold value. \n
 *                        This means that when the external interrupt priority is greater than this maximum value, the execution of the flash function is disturbed by this interrupt.
 *                      - machine timer and software interrupt will definitely interrupt the flash functions execution, they are not controlled by the plic interrupt threshold
 *                  - In other cases(preempt_en = 0 or plic_preempt_feature_en = 0), global interrupts (including machine timer and software interrupt) will be turned off during the execution of the flash functions and will be restored when the flash functions exits.
 *              -# If the flash operation may be interrupted by an interrupt, it is necessary to ensure that the interrupt handling function and the function it calls must be in the RAM code.
